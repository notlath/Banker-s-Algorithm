# Banker's Algorithm in Java

This project implements the Banker's Algorithm in Java. The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an "s-state" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

## Usage

To run the program, compile the Java file and then run it:

```sh
javac BankersAlgorithm.java
java BankersAlgorithm
```
